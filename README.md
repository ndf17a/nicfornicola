# Nic Fornicola
I am a Computer Science Major at Abilene Christian University, I have been coding in C++ and Java, Javascript, and some HTML and CSS, here is some of my class work (mostly my own implementations of data structs) and some projects.

The projects are more detailed in other repositories.This is just for everything to be in one place.
